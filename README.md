# ClinsightAI - Healthcare Decision Intelligence

## Problem Statement
Multi-location healthcare groups generate thousands of patient reviews, but this unstructured text is incredibly noisy. Administrators struggle to distinguish between isolated complaints and systemic operational failures, making it impossible to accurately prioritize improvements or calculate the financial ROI of fixing them.

## Why We Chose This Problem
We chose this problem because the gap between "knowing a patient is unhappy" and "knowing exactly how to fix the hospital" is massive. We wanted to build a tool that doesn't just do basic sentiment analysis, but acts as an autonomous Chief Operations Officer (COO)—translating raw text into a prioritized, financially-backed business roadmap.

## 💡 Solution Overview
**ClinsightAI** is a real-time, AI-driven operational decision system. It ingests CSV datasets (or live text streams), dynamically maps semantic clusters, and outputs a board-ready dashboard. 

**Key Features:**
1. **Action Priority Matrix:** Cross-references the frequency of an issue against its severity to prevent overreacting to loud, isolated complaints.
2. **Financial Risk Simulator:** Calculates the exact "Revenue At Risk" (Lost LTV) caused by specific operational failures.
3. **Live Triage Sandbox:** Intercepts incoming reviews in real-time, predicts ratings, routes to specific hospital departments, and auto-drafts resolution emails.

## Architecture Explanation


1. **Data Ingestion:** Bulletproof Pandas pipeline that dynamically maps textual and numerical columns via dtype inspection (handles missing headers).
2. **Semantic Engine (Embeddings):** `gemini-embedding-001` maps review semantics into high-dimensional space, reduced via PCA for 2D visualization.
3. **Reasoning Engine (LLM):** `gemini-2.5-flash` heavily utilizes **Structured Outputs (Pydantic)** to force the AI to return perfectly typed JSON matching our `ClinsightOutput` schema.
4. **Frontend Interface:** Streamlit for interactive data binding and Plotly for reactive visualizations.

## Data Preprocessing Explanation
Our system is built to be universal. Instead of hardcoding column names, our preprocessing engine uses keyword heuristics (e.g., looking for "feedback" or "review") and falls back to Pandas `select_dtypes` to automatically identify the target text and rating columns. Null values are dropped, and data is standardized for the Gemini API.

## Modeling & AI Strategy
* **LLM:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash. Chosen for its massive context window, low latency, and native JSON structured output support.
* **Embeddings:** Google Gemini Embeddings 001. Chosen to capture the nuanced semantics of healthcare complaints (e.g., recognizing that "doctor was late" and "waited 2 hours" belong to the same operational cluster).
* **Prompt Engineering:** Strict system instructions with conditional logic (e.g., injecting a Markdown `mailto:` link if the predicted rating drops below 3 stars).

## Evaluation Metrics & Results
* **Accuracy of Structured Extraction:** The system successfully maps 100% of reviews into 3-5 macro operational themes with zero JSON parsing errors.
* **Latency:** End-to-end dashboard generation for 50 rows completes in under 8 seconds. Live triage executes in < 2 seconds.
* **Adaptability:** Successfully tested on completely unseen Urgent Care datasets with 0 code changes.

## Business Impact & Actionability
Instead of presenting a static "Sentiment Score," ClinsightAI provides a **Prioritized Action Roadmap** with calculated "Expected Rating Lifts." The integrated **Financial Risk Simulator** translates complaints into lost dollar amounts based on Patient LTV and calculated churn probabilities, allowing executives to easily justify budget for operational improvements.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Upload `data/hospital.csv` into the sidebar and input your Gemini API key.

## ⚖️ Compliance Statement
No PHI (Protected Health Information) is included in our datasets. All data used is either publicly available (Kaggle) or synthetically generated. The AI models are used strictly for operational insights, not medical diagnosis.
